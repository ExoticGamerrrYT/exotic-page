            Hello! I am Exotic. I love playing Grand Theft 
            Auto V Online. I am also a kind of developer, I got interested in 
            it when I was 11; I made a game with scratch, then in Game Maker
             Studio, after that my 
            parents listed me in a Python class (I am listed in the class already)
             where I learn Python, my main 
            language (but for the game developing I had to use C#, GDScript, Blueprints, etc.).
